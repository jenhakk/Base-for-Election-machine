# Base-for-Election-machine
 
 This is an ongoing project that I keep updating so there can be little errors and elements may not be in their final places.  

It is created for a school project where we (two other students) create a fantasy election machine using Java, JSP, Servlets, DAO, databases (MySQL) and HTML/CSS/Boostrap. This repo is for creating the html layout that we will use in jsp files.
